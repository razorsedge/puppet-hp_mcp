Examples
--------

```puppet
include hp_mcp
```

```puppet
# Parameterized Class:
class { 'hp_mcp':
  install_smh               => true,
  smh_gid                   => 1000,
  smh_uid                   => 2000,

}
```

Notes
-----

* Only tested on CentOS 6.4 x86_64 on a HP DL360 G5.

Issues
------

* HP YUM repositories are inconsistent between CentOS and Oracle.  The `current` link may point to version 10.10 on one OS and 9.50 on another.  Additionally, the hpacucli and cpqacuxe packages are missing in the EL5 9.50 repo while they are present in the 9.40 repo.

TODO
----

* None
